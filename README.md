# Amazon Event

## Assignment

This is a school assignment in which the programs Web Developer and IP Graphical Production & Form at Yrgo are collaborating. In this project we are going to create an event invitation in both physical and digital form for a real company.

We decided to create an event for Chalmers Students for Sustainability and focus on the decreasing diversity of different cultures in the amazon region and what impact it has on us and future generations.


Project requirements:
- A unique landing page that follows the same graphic manner of the chosen company.
- The website needs to be responsive and built mobile-first and follow the accessibility standard WCAG (https://a11yproject.com/checklist/).
- It must contain at least five animations, one of which is an in-animation when the page is first displayed.
- It should have a CTA where visitors can sign up via a form to the event. This form only needs to be shown visually.
- The landing page should be personalized via a link that can be sent out with query parameters. Suggestions for at least two ways to personify the site via the link such as name, country, pictures, occupational group, etc.
- The website should be built statically through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- From day one, the website should be pushed up to a public repository on GitHub.
- The website should upload to a hosting service such as. Netlify, Vercel or GitHub Pages.
- The website should be optimized and have as high a score as possible on https://web.dev/ (optimize images, CSS and JS, tips are to use construction tools such as Parcel).
- Each group must submit a review of another group the day before the presentation. Code reviews must be submitted with a pull request.
